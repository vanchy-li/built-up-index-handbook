# UI, IBI, and NDBaI – The Evolution

After NDBI, researchers created new indices to fix its limitations.

## UI (Urban Index)
- Focuses on better separation of urban vs. non-urban areas.

## IBI (Index-based Built-up Index)
- A “combo index” combining NDBI, SAVI, and MNDWI.

## NDBaI (New Built-up Index)
- Improved NDBI formula with better discrimination of bare soil.

👉 These indices set the stage for future innovations – including **VBI**.
