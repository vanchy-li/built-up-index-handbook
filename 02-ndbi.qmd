# NDBI – Normalized Difference Built-up Index

The **Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI)**, proposed by Zha et al. (2003), is the most widely used index for detecting built-up areas.

## 📐 Formula
$$
NDBI = \frac{SWIR - NIR}{SWIR + NIR}
$$

- **SWIR (Short-Wave Infrared)** reflects strongly from urban materials (concrete, asphalt).
- **NIR (Near-Infrared)** reflects from vegetation.

## 🛰️ Code Example (Google Earth Engine)
```python
ndbi = image.normalizedDifference(['B11','B8']).rename('NDBI')
